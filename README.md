# üê≤ Hydra

Combine Medusa with Hydra for modularity. 

The goal of Hydra is to be an entry point gateway proxy that allows you to deploy frontends modularly. It is a ready-for-use combination of a gateway with service discovery, load balancing, and JWT security. It uses proven frameworks like Spring Cloud Gateway and Service Discovery behind the scenes but streamlines their setup.

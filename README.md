The goal of Hydra is to be an entry point gateway proxy that allows you to deploy frontends modularly. It is a ready-for-use combination of a gateway with service discovery, load balancing, and JWT security. It uses proven frameworks like Spring Cloud Gateway and Service Discovery behind the scenes but streamlines their setup.

## Running the sample implementation locally
If you wish to use the Postgres sample implementation, set up a local postgres (https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

If neccesary, update values in the `application.yml`. 

```yaml
spring:
  r2dbc:
    url: "r2dbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/local_example"
    username: postgres
    password: pass123
```
We're using a reactive DB driver here, hence the r2dbc. Specific implementation is up to your discretion.

Then in the database, we need one table - to match with the user records:
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.hydra_user(
    id serial primary key,
    encoded_password text NOT NULL,
    username text NOT NULL,
    roles text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''::text,
    account_expired boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    account_locked boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    credentials_expired boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
    enabled boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);
```

No need to set up users yourself, the sample implementation adds a default user for you to use (and login form will be pre-filled with its credentials).

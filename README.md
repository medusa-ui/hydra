[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/bcc42d042ef5433aa6913ded9ba80da7)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/medusa-ui/hydra/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=medusa-ui/hydra&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

The goal of Hydra is to be an entry point gateway proxy that allows you to deploy frontends modularly. It is a ready-for-use combination of a gateway with service discovery, load balancing, and JWT security. It uses proven frameworks like Spring Cloud Gateway and Service Discovery behind the scenes but streamlines their setup.
